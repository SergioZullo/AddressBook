The problem was simple to resolve and I didn't use others libraries to maintain the application simple and 
clear to understand. 

The first step was the read of the file, assuming that form, I put all information for each line
in an object called Person. I tried to separate every information such as name and surname for 
future developments and searched. All the Person object are saved in one ArrayList because it's easy to get information 
and works faster and better than an array.

1. To resolve the first issue I passing through the ArrayList and counted every Male person in the list.
2. To resolve the second I used a new object that implements Comparator, with this class I could order 
   the ArrayList with the method sort and get the first element i.e. the oldest.
3. The Last one was easy to get but to be reusable I continued to work with the person object and after 
   some controls, the procedure return the exact days of difference between two person.
   
Some tests that I did 

File Empty - file not found 
One Element in the file 
Tested correctly the sort on the date
